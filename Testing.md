## Testing
As a developer, our primary goal is to build software that works.
To ensure our software works, we test the application.

## Manual Testing
An individual will open the website, interact with the website and ensure everything works as intended.
If a new feature is released, you repeat the same steps.
You may  have to test not only the new feature but also the existing features

Drawbacks: 
    1. Time Consuming
    2. Complex repetitive tasks has a risk of human error
    3. You may not get a chance to test all the features you should.

## Automated Testing
Automated tests are programs that automate the task of testing your software.
Write code to test the software code.
Additional effort required when you develop a feature

Advantages
    1. Not time consuming
    2. Reliable, consistent and not error prone
    3. Easy to identify and fix features that break tests
    4. Gives confidence when shipping software.
